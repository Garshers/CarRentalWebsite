        We provide our customers with the vehicles they need, which is why we also offer cargo van rentals. These vehicles are perfect for larger shopping trips, moving, or renovations. They allow you to transport heavy and bulky loads safely and conveniently.

        A cargo van from our rental service can be helpful for your company in case of fleet breakdowns or if you don't yet own a vehicle of this size but already know how you could use it.

        <strong style="font-size: 32px;">Short-Term Car Rental</strong><br>
        Short-term car rental is a smart solution for temporary vehicle needs. Quickly and affordably secure a replacement car while your own is being repaired, or rent a more spacious and comfortable car for a business trip or a weekend getaway with family.
        <br><br>
        Renting a car short-term with <strong>CARENTAL Polska</strong> involves minimal paperwork. Use our online search tool to find the car you need and book it conveniently online or via phone with our consultants. Booking online also gives you a discount on your rental!
        <br><br>
        <strong style="font-size: 32px;">Car Rental for Your Business with CARENTAL Polska</strong><br>
        Renting a car for your business is a cost-effective option in two ways. A short-term rental provides a reliable vehicle tailored to your immediate needs, whether for urgent tasks or unforeseen requirements. This option is popular not only with large corporations but also increasingly with small and medium-sized businesses.
        <br><br>
        Medium-term car rental offers a great alternative to leasing. Entrepreneurs appreciate the ease of cost optimization and the convenience of VAT invoicing. These benefits make car rentals an attractive solution for micro-businesses and sole proprietors looking for a representative vehicle.
        <br><br>
        <strong style="font-size: 32px;">Medium-Term Car Rentals</strong><br>
        Value convenience? Opt for medium-term car rental with <strong>CARENTAL Polska</strong>! Unlike leasing, all the paperwork is completed in one visit to our branch. Working with us won’t affect your credit line.
        <br><br>
        Medium-term rentals are also available for private clients. Rent a car for a few weeks or months for vacations, relocations, or simply to enjoy a comfortable, fully equipped, new vehicle for a fraction of its market price.
